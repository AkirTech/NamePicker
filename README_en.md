# NamePicker

***The software based on Python which is used to pick name (other objects) randomly.***

## Welcome to NamePicker!

This is the repository of NamePicker , whose owner is Akir_ , welcome!

## Who will be using it?

Well , imagine you are a teacher longing for a software to help him/her pick a student in class randomly , how would you do?

If you are unsure about other software , get a load of here!

In fact , this software serves more than name picking , knowing its data frame , you can do far more than that!

## Get start.

1. Prepare your own database file.
   
   It should contain only one table .
   
   In this table ,the columns below are necessary!(If you are not sure how to creat your own database , see the file "17.db" in the root directory of NamePicker.)
   > But the default database file had been removed from the root directory 
   > 
   > in the latest version of NamePicker , but we also provided the link of 
   > 
   > example database file in the release page.
   > 
   > |ID|NAME|
   > |:--:|:--:|
   > |1|Elon Mask|
   > |2|Donald J. Trump|
   > |3|......|
2. Drop it into the root directory of NamePicker and remember to remove the "17.db" file !!!!(Or it would except error!)
3. Click the executable file(different file name in different versions)  or click the desktop shortcut to launch it! (Shortcut icon is only automatically created by 
   
   the installer in the version 2.3+ !)
   |Version|Executable file name|
   |--|--|
   |v0.x|Class17NamePicker.exe|
   |v1.x|RandomPicker.exe|
   |v2.x|loader.exe,RandomCore.exe/modifier.exe|
4. See who's the lucky dog!
